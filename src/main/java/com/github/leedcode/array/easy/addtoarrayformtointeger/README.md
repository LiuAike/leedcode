### Describetion
For a non-negative integer X, the array-form of X is an array of its digits in left to right order. 
For example, if X = 1231, then the array form is [1,2,3,1].

Given the array-form A of a non-negative integer X, return the array-form of the integer X+K.

### Example:
Input: A = [1,2,0,0], K = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234

Input: A = [2,7,4], K = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455

### Note:
1 <= A.length <= 10000
0 <= A[i] <= 9
0 <= K <= 10000
If A.length > 1, then A[0] != 0
