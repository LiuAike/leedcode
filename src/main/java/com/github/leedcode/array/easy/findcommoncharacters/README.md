### Describetion
Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show 
up in all strings within the list (including duplicates).  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in 
all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

### Example:
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]

Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]

### Note:
1 <= A.length <= 100
1 <= A[i].length <= 100
A[i][j] is a lowercase letter
